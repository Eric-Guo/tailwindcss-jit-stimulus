### Matlib Rails + Shakapacker Project Structure

- The Rails app entry is `config/routes.rb` (draws `config/routes/api.rb`).
- HTML views are under `app/views/**`; API JSON responses use Jbuilder under `app/views/api/**`.
- Controllers live in `app/controllers/**` and API controllers in `app/controllers/api/**`.
- Frontend pack entry: [`app/packs/entrypoints/application.js`](mdc:app/packs/entrypoints/application.js) with Stimulus controllers in `app/packs/controllers/**`.
- Webpack is configured via [`config/webpack/webpack.config.js`](mdc:config/webpack/webpack.config.js) using Shakapacker.

#### Key files
- Routes: [`config/routes.rb`](mdc:config/routes.rb), [`config/routes/api.rb`](mdc:config/routes/api.rb)
- Base controller: [`app/controllers/application_controller.rb`](mdc:app/controllers/application_controller.rb)
- Stimulus application pack: [`app/packs/entrypoints/application.js`](mdc:app/packs/entrypoints/application.js)

#### Conventions
- API endpoints return JSON built with Jbuilder templates aligned by controller/action path.
- Stimulus controllers are auto-registered from `app/packs/controllers/**`.
- Use `rails routes` to inspect endpoints and match to controllers/views.
