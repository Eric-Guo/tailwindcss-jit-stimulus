### Shakapacker / Webpack

- Webpack config is generated via Shakapacker and extended in [`config/webpack/webpack.config.js`](mdc:config/webpack/webpack.config.js).
- Entry points live under `app/packs/entrypoints/**`; images, styles, and controllers are imported from `app/packs/**`.
- Prefer adding webpack customizations by merging `customConfig` in the exported config.

#### Tips
- Ensure loaders handle fonts (`@fontsource/*`), images, and CSS imported in the pack.
- If adding new entrypoints, create files in `app/packs/entrypoints` and reference them in layouts via `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag`/`stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag` (Shakapacker helpers).
